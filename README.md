Homework for Parallel Programming at Plovdiv University

A fully automated online shop stores information about available quantities of its items on sale.  Buyers can flock to the store and send orders, while suppliers can at the same time also add information about new items being (re)stocked.  Each supplier can stock one or multiple items.  Each buyer can buy one or multiple items.
